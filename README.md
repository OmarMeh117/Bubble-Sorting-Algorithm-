# Please take note that the bubble sort algorithm that I have created can only use high numbers like 1000 or so, otherwise anything else will give you a time of 0.00.
# Continuation of last comment if you want to use this effectively, try using 10000 items or more.
# This Algorithm that I have created tested two bubble sorts, a simple bubble sort and an advanced bubble sort which tested their time.
